# Location Based Quiz - Question Setting App

This repository contains the code used to create a phonegap app that is an adminstrator interface to set the questions for a location based quiz. This app aims to:

* Show a form where the administrator can set the questions and its answers for the quiz.
* Show a Leaflet map that can be clicked on to give the latitude and longitude for the question, and then populate the text boxes with this lcoation.
* Send the question to a database.
* Present the questions that are already in the database as markers on the map.
