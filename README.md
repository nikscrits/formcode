# Location Based Quiz - Question Setting App

This repository contains the code used to create a phonegap app that is an adminstrator interface to set the questions for a location based quiz. This app aims to:

* Show a form where the administrator can set the questions and its answers for the quiz.
* Show a Leaflet map that can be clicked on to give the latitude and longitude for the question, and then populate the text boxes with this location.
* Send the question to a database.
* Present the questions that are already in the database as markers on the map.

It can be accessed from [this link](https://http://developer.cege.ucl.ac.uk:31288/) when both the [httpServer.js](https://github.com/nikscrits/server) and the phonegap server (found in the 'ucesncr' file of this repo) are running. The user help guide for this webpage can be found as a html page [here](https://rawgit.com/nikscrits/questions/master/userguide/Questions%20User%20Guide.html).
